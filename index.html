  <h2 style="font-size: 30px;"> Landon Melton</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Landon—a 24-year-old Kentuckian who recently moved to Massachusetts in January 2025 and now call the Worcester area my home. Life for me is about exploring and creating, whether it's traveling to new destinations, hanging out with friends, or joining kickball and running groups. You'll often catch me navigating the aisles of Trader Joe's and Costco, enjoying Kachava shakes, or indulging my love for shopping.</p>

   <p> I'm also a proud caretaker of my little aquatic world, home to my betta fish named Alexandopher, a snail named Snail, and—well—100 nuisance snails that hitchhiked on my aquatic plants. I enjoy nurturing and growing house plants, as well as aquatic plants in my fish tank. It’s a peaceful and rewarding hobby that keeps my green thumb busy.</p>
    
    <p>By profession, I'm an engineer specializing in filtration applications, a field that combines precision and problem-solving. This website is a personal passion project aimed at learning HTML coding and hosting—exploring the art of creating something from scratch while challenging myself to build a site with its own unique domain.</p>
  
    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my little corner of the web!</p>
