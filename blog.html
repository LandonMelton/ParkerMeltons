      <h2 class="blog-title">The Tale of Alexandopher and the Invaders</h2>
      <p class="blog-details">April 14th, 2025 | Author: Landon Melton</p>
      </header>
      <!--Summary and collapsable content-->
      <article>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">When Alexandopher first arrived at his new home, he was barely a shadow of himself. His delicate, pale-white fins shimmered faintly as he floated in the water. Petco had been kind to him in some ways, but the bustling tanks full of strangers had left him subdued. Yet I saw promise in his quiet beauty, welcoming him into the carefully curated aquatic haven with open arms. It was here that Alexandopher began his transformation.</p>
     <details>
      <Summary class ="read-more">Read more...</Summary>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Seconds turned into hours, and Alexandopher's pale hues gave way to an extraordinary bloom. His fins unfurled like silk in the water, radiating shades of regal purple and electric blue. It was as though he had discovered his true self in the loving embrace of his new home. Alexandopher had become a true gem, the pride of the tank. And he was not alone in this journey—for beside him was his steadfast companion, Snail.
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Snail had always been the quiet observer, inching across the glass walls with determination. Together, Alexandopher and Snail established harmony in their aquatic realm. They tended to the plants and maintained order—or so they thought. But soon, the delicate balance of their world was disturbed.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Unbeknownst to them, the aquatic plants had brought unwelcome guests: the nuisance snails. Hundreds of them! These invaders, bold and relentless, began their campaign to overthrow Alexandopher’s territory. With their sheer numbers, they threatened to suffocate the once-thriving ecosystem.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">But Alexandopher was no ordinary fish. He was a leader, a warrior in vibrant armor. He partnered with Snail, who proved an unlikely hero—despite his unassuming demeanor, Snail was deeply invested in defending their home. The duo launched their mission against the invaders, developing strategies to reclaim control. Alexandopher patrolled the borders of the tank, while Snail worked tirelessly to limit the nuisance snails' spread. Their efforts were brave, but the invaders' numbers seemed endless.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">It was then that Landon intervened, introducing a formidable ally: the assassin snail. Stealthy and efficient, the assassin snail quickly proved itself an invaluable addition to the team. With the three defenders working in harmony, the tide began to turn. Slowly but surely, Alexandopher's aquatic realm was restored to its former glory, the nuisance snails retreating in defeat.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Today, Alexandopher glides through his tank with pride, his vivid colors a testament to his resilience and courage. Snail continues his diligent patrols, and the assassin snail watches over them like a quiet guardian. Together, they’ve rebuilt their home—a testament to teamwork and determination. The invaders may have been bold, but they underestimated the strength of Alexandopher and his friends. And in their little aquatic corner of the world, peace reigns once more.</p>

      <h2 class="blog-title">SkyMiles: Negotiating for what I Deserve</h2>
      <p class="blog-details">April 17th, 2025 | Author: Landon Melton</p>
      </header>
      <!--Summary and collapsable content-->
      <article>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Who knew you could negotiate with Delta? This discovery came during an unexpected adventure when numerous delays caused me to miss a flight, leaving me stranded in Detroit overnight. While the inconvenience could have been frustrating, I wasn’t too upset. Delta had graciously covered my hotel, or at least I knew my job would have if they hadn’t—after all, this was part of my work trip to Wisconsin.</p>
     <details>
      <Summary class ="read-more">Read more...</Summary>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Navigating Delta’s app to reach customer service was a challenge; their chat feature isn’t exactly intuitive to find. Eventually, after a few back-and-forth messages with a bot (thanks to some prompts from Copilot), I managed to get connected to an actual human representative named Abraham.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Abraham listened to my situation and kindly offered me 3,000 SkyMiles as compensation for my troubles. While I appreciated the gesture, I decided this was my chance to test the waters of negotiation. Politely but firmly, I requested either 6,000 SkyMiles or silver status—since I was oh-so-close to reaching it. To my surprise, Abraham didn’t hesitate to go the extra mile (pun intended). Within 30 minutes, the 6,000 SkyMiles were sitting pretty in my account.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">This experience was an eye-opener: negotiating doesn’t have to be intimidating, and it can lead to surprisingly easy wins when the customer service is good and the inconvenience is valid. Moving forward, I’ve adopted a new strategy—to politely ask for compensation whenever I’m inconvenienced. After all, my time is valuable, and companies like Delta have demonstrated they’re willing to make things right.</p>
      <p class="blog-paragraph">Delta taught me an important lesson: there’s nothing to lose by asking, especially when backed by good reasoning and a positive attitude. And now, with my newfound confidence in negotiating, I’m determined to keep improving this skill—because whether it’s an airline or any other service, recognizing the worth of my time is a victory in itself.</p>
